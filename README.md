### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently working on fun personnal project where I can test some ML/DL techniques:
* [Spotify Song Classification](https://github.com/sqrx-mckl/spotify_app)  
I use Spotify audio features to cluster my songs and get a dynamic plot. Later on the goal would be to cluster multiple playlist together...
* [Driver Behaviour Study/Analysis with DL](https://github.com/sqrx-mckl/driver_behaviour)  
After have worked in the automotive sector for 3 years, I tested with public data how to cluster the driver different behaviour in a corner in an heuristic fashion.
